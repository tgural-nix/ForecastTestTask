# Forecast App

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project and create a new repository (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab ...). Do not fork the project ⛔️
2. Commit your work when you're done.

## What to Do During This Test 📱👨🏼‍💻

1. Implement the `forecastService` in the ViewModel using dependency injection.
2. Display the day and description in the list.
3. Implement swipe-to-delete functionality in the list.
4. Implement navigation using the coordinator pattern.
5. Create a SwiftUI detail view; design is up to you :) 👩🏽‍🎨 👨🏼‍🎨.
6. **Bonus:** Add a demo mode by replacing a Service, which should return static data instead of the one returned by the networking service.

## Info

- Some assets are already in the project 📸.
- Some TODOs are included to help you during the test.
